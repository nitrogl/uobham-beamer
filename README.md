University of Birmingham LaTeX beamer template

Unofficial LaTeX beamer style for outstanding and professional presentations.

Colours and proportions try to follow as much as possible the [**University slide catalogue**](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/documents/public/brand/generic-master-template-16-9-white.pptx)

## Example

The following are images extracted from the compiled example you can find [**here (light theme)**](https://github.com/nitrogl/uobham-beamer/blob/main/examples/uobham-example-light-theme.pdf) or here [**here (dark theme)**](https://github.com/nitrogl/uobham-beamer/blob/main/examples/uobham-example-dark-theme.pdf)

## Usage
The easiest way is that of cloning the repository

    git clone https://github.com/nitrogl/uobham-beamer.git

and modify the .tex sample file (of course, rename it as you need).

If you are not starting a presentation from scratch, however, you can just copy the style file along with its directory `uobham-beamer`

+ uobham-beamer.sty
+ uobham-beamer/

to the base directory of your project.
Remember to include the package just below `\documentclass`, like you can see in the sample .tex file.

    \usepackage{uobham-beamer}

Further customisation is possible through few commands/rules.
